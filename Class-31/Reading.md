## Django REST Framework & Docker:

### Q1. What are the key components of a Docker container, and how do they help streamline the development and deployment of applications?

#### 1.Components:

- Docker Image: Self-contained application package.
- Docker Engine: Manages containers and their execution.

#### 2.Benefits:

Portability: Consistent environments across systems.
Efficiency: Lightweight and resource-friendly.
Scalability: Easily scale applications as needed.
CI/CD: Smooth integration and deployment processes.
Isolation: Applications are isolated from the host system.
Versioning: Track changes and roll back if needed.

### Q2. Describe the primary steps involved in building a library website using Django, including essential components like models, views, and templates.

Django is a popular web framework for Python that follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. In Django, the Model represents the data, the View handles the user interface, and the Controller manages the logic and data flow.

#### steps for building a library website using Django:

- Set up Django project and app.
- Define models for data entities (e.g., Book, Author).
- Create database tables with migrations.
- Configure the admin interface for data management.
- Define views and templates for the website's pages.
- Set up URL routing to map views to URLs.
- Handle static files (CSS, JS, images) for styling and interactivity.
- Implement user authentication.
- Deploy the Django app to a web server.

### Q3. Can you explain the primary differences between Django and Django REST framework?

Django is a web framework for building full-stack web applications, while Django REST framework (DRF) is an extension of Django focused on creating powerful RESTful APIs. Django handles web applications with HTML-based views, while DRF is designed for building APIs to communicate with other applications.
