## Ten Data Analysis:

### Q1. What are the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab, and how does it differ from Jupyter Notebook?

JupyterLab is an advanced development environment that builds upon Jupyter Notebook. Its key features include a flexible user interface, support for multiple document formats, an integrated code console, enhanced code editor, extensibility through extensions, improved notebook interface, integrated file browser, and collaborative capabilities. JupyterLab provides a comprehensive and powerful environment for data exploration, analysis, and interactive coding workflows.


### Q2. What are the main functionalities provided by the NumPy library, and how can it be useful in Python programming, particularly for scientific computing and data manipulation tasks?

 Its main functionalities include multi-dimensional arrays, mathematical functions, array manipulation, broadcasting, linear algebra operations, random number generation, and seamless integration with other scientific libraries. NumPy is essential for scientific computing, data manipulation, and tasks like numerical simulations, statistics, and machine learning.

 ### Q3. Explain the basic structure and properties of NumPy arrays, and provide examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on them.

 NumPy arrays are homogeneous, fixed-size, and multi-dimensional containers. You can create arrays using lists, tuples, or built-in functions. Arrays have properties like shape and data type. Manipulations include reshaping, indexing, and slicing. Operations can be element-wise or involve mathematical functions. NumPy arrays are essential for efficient numerical computations and data manipulation.
