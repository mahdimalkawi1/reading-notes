# Read: Class 01

## Some specific challenges that beginners may face:

1. Python has a specific way of organizing code.

2. Python is commonly used for data science and analysis, which requires knowledge of data structures and algorithms.

## Strategies for beginners:

1. Find a community: Beginners should consider joining a Python community or finding a study group where they can ask questions, share resources, and collaborate on projects. 

2. Build projects: Beginners should try to build projects that interest them, whether it's a simple game, a web application, or a data analysis tool. 

## After reading “Beginners Guide to Big O,” explain the concept of time complexity and space complexity.


Time complexity is the measure of how long an algorithm takes to solve a problem as the input size increases. Space complexity is the measure of how much memory an algorithm needs to solve a problem as the input size increases. Both are usually expressed using Big O notation and optimizing one can come at the cost of the other.

## Based on the “Names and Values in Python” reading, explain the difference between mutable and immutable data types in Python.

Mutable objects in Python can be modified after they are created, while immutable objects cannot be modified. Examples of mutable objects include lists, dictionaries, and sets, while examples of immutable objects include strings, numbers, and tuples. Modifying a mutable object can cause unexpected side effects, while immutable objects are easier to reason about.
