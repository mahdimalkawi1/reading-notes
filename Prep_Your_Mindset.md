 Carol Dweck discusses the concept of a "growth mindset" which involves believing that one's abilities and intelligence can be developed through hard work, dedication, and learning. She contrasts this with a "fixed mindset," which assumes that abilities and intelligence are predetermined and cannot be changed. Dweck emphasizes that adopting a growth mindset can lead to greater resilience, creativity, and achievement in both personal and professional pursuits. She also offers tips for developing a growth mindset, such as focusing on progress rather than perfection and embracing challenges as opportunities for learning and growth.

 Angela Lee Duckworth discusses the concept of "grit" which is defined as passion and perseverance for long-term goals. She argues that grit is a better predictor of success than intelligence or talent alone. Duckworth shares examples from her research, including a study of West Point cadets, and highlights the importance of developing grit in children and adults. She also discusses strategies for cultivating grit, such as finding a sense of purpose and meaning, staying optimistic in the face of adversity, and embracing challenges as opportunities for growth. Duckworth concludes by emphasizing that grit is a key factor in achieving personal and professional goals, and encourages individuals to develop and maintain it throughout their lives.

 philosopher Alain de Botton argues that our society's definition of success is often narrow and harmful. He encourages a shift towards a kinder, gentler philosophy of success that takes into account the complexities of human experience and values qualities such as empathy, self-awareness, and resilience. De Botton argues that our ideas about success are heavily influenced by capitalism and the media, which promote a focus on external markers of success such as wealth, power, and fame. He suggests that a healthier approach to success would involve understanding our own unique strengths and weaknesses, accepting our flaws and failures, and pursuing goals that align with our personal values and interests. De Botton concludes by emphasizing the importance of cultivating a sense of perspective and empathy, and encourages individuals to embrace a more compassionate and nuanced view of success.


# Measuring Emotional Intelligence
I got a score of 21 on the four components of Emotional Intelligence. It seems that I'm doing well in all of the areas. However, I learned that if my score was below 18 in any component, it would indicate an area where I could improve. I appreciate the information that Emotional Intelligence is learnable and developmental. The advice to use feedback from others, mentoring within my organization or friendship is helpful.



 # Assessing Bias 
Upon completing the Bias Self-Assessment, my score was 107. According to the assessment, a score between 100 and 120 indicates high self-awareness, curiosity, and courage. While this is a positive result, I understand that this is an ongoing journey, and there is always room for improvement. Based on the results, I plan to examine the areas of unconscious bias where I scored the lowest to determine where I can further improve. I am interested in identifying my strongest and weakest areas and will focus on the areas I scored the lowest on in the coming weeks and beyond. Overall, this assessment was helpful in guiding me towards areas where I can improve and become more self-aware.
