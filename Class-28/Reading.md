## Django CRUD and Forms:

### Q1. How do Django Forms facilitate user input handling, and what are some key components of creating a form using the Django framework?

Django Forms facilitate user input handling by providing a convenient way to define and manage HTML forms and process user-submitted data. <br> 
The key components of creating a form using Django are:

- Define a form class with fields.
- Render the form in a view or template.
- Handle form submission in a view.
- Validate the form data.
- Display form errors if validation fails.
- Save or process the form data as needed.

Django Forms simplify the process of handling user input, including validation, error handling, and HTML rendering.


### Q2. Explain the purpose of Django Templates in web development and describe how template inheritance can be utilized to improve code reusability and maintainability.

Django Templates separate presentation logic from Python code in web development. They allow for creating dynamic web pages and utilize template inheritance to improve code reusability and maintainability. Base templates define common elements, while derived templates inherit from the base template and can override or add specific sections. This approach promotes modularity, extensibility, and easier updates.


### Q3. Describe the function of Django Views in handling HTTP requests, and outline the differences between function-based views and class-based views.


Django Views handle HTTP requests and generate responses. Function-based views are simpler and offer more control, while class-based views provide structured and reusable code through inheritance and built-in functionality.
