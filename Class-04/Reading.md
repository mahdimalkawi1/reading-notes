## Classes and Objects and Thinking Recursively:

### Q1. What are the key differences between classes and objects in Python, and how are they used to create and manage instances of a class?

In Python, a class is like a blueprint for creating objects. It defines what attributes and methods an object will have. An object is an instance of a class, which means it has its own set of values for the attributes defined in the class. To create an object, you simply instantiate the class using the class name followed by parentheses. You can then access the attributes and methods of the object using dot notation.

### Q2. Explain the concept of recursion and provide an example of how it can be used to solve a problem in Python. What are some best practices to follow when implementing a recursive function?

Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself until a base case is reached. It's often used when a problem can be broken down into smaller sub-problems. One example of a recursive function is the factorial function. Best practices when implementing recursive functions include ensuring that the base case is reached and optimizing to avoid redundant computations. It's also important to consider whether recursion is the most efficient approach for a given problem.

### Q3. What is the purpose of pytest fixtures and code coverage in testing Python code? Explain how they can be used together to improve the quality and maintainability of a project.

Pytest fixtures help set up and tear down resources for tests, while code coverage measures how much of your code is being tested. Together, they can improve the quality and maintainability of your Python projects.
