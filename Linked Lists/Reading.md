# Linked Lists:

## Big O

Data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes where each node has a reference to the next node. The discussion covers the two types of Linked Lists (Singly and Doubly), their implementation in programming languages, and their advantages and disadvantages. Linked Lists are useful for storing collections of items when the number of elements is changing frequently or unknown, but have higher memory usage and are not efficient when searching for elements.
