# Read: Stacks & Queues

## Stacks:

 A stack is a collection of elements that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It supports two main operations: push and pop. Push adds an element to the top of the stack, while pop removes the topmost element. The resource provides code examples in Python to demonstrate the implementation of stacks using arrays and linked lists. It covers creating a stack, pushing and popping elements, and checking if the stack is empty. The resource also discusses common use cases for stacks, such as managing function calls and recursion (using the call stack), implementing undo/redo functionality, and solving problems like depth-first search.

 ## Queues:

A queue is a collection of elements that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It supports two primary operations: enqueue and dequeue. Enqueue adds an element to the end of the queue, while dequeue removes the element from the front. The resource provides code examples in Python to demonstrate the implementation of queues using arrays and linked lists. It covers creating a queue, enqueuing and dequeuing elements, and checking if the queue is empty. The resource also discusses common use cases for queues, such as managing tasks or jobs in a system, handling requests, and solving problems like breadth-first search.
