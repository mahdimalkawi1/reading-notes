## React 1:

### Q1. In the context of ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview, what are three key features introduced in ES6 that improve upon the previous version of JavaScript, and briefly explain their benefits?

**Arrow Functions:**<br>

Benefit: Concise syntax for functions, with lexical this for avoiding scoping issues.

**Block-Scoped Variables (let and const):**<br>

Benefit: Block-scoped variables (let, const) improve scoping clarity and prevent hoisting problems.

**Template Literals:**<br>

Benefit: Readable and flexible strings with placeholders, supporting multiline and expression interpolation.

### Q2. After reading “Tailwind in 15 minutes,” can you describe the purpose of utility classes in Tailwind CSS and provide an example of how to use them to style an HTML element?

Utility classes are a core concept in Tailwind CSS that enable you to apply specific styles directly to HTML elements by adding classes to them. Each utility class represents a single styling rule, making it quick and efficient to create and modify styles without writing custom CSS.

For instance, let's say you want to style a button element using utility classes:

```
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-600 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded">
  Click me
</button>
```

In this example:

- bg-blue-500 sets the background color to a shade of blue.
- hover:bg-blue-600 changes the background color when hovering over the button.
- text-white sets the text color to white.
- font-bold applies a bold font weight.
- py-2 and px-4 add vertical and horizontal padding, respectively.
- rounded rounds the corners of the button.

 By using utility classes, you can easily combine and customize these styles, and even modify them based on breakpoints for responsive design, all without writing custom CSS. This approach allows for rapid development and consistent styling across your project.

### Q3. Based on “Why to use Next.js,” explain the main advantages of using Next.js for web development, and provide a brief comparison between traditional client-side rendering and Next.js’s server-side rendering approach.

#### Advantages of Using Next.js:

1. Server-Side Rendering (SSR) and Static Site Generation (SSG): Faster initial page loads, better SEO, and improved user experience.
2. Automatic Code Splitting: Smaller and faster-loading bundles.
3. Simplified Routing: Intuitive file-based routing system.
CSS and Sass Support: Scoped styling, avoiding global conflicts.
4. API Routes: Built-in serverless API route creation.
5. Automatic Prefetching: Enhanced user experience through page prefetching.
#### Comparison - Traditional CSR vs. Next.js SSR:

- CSR: Dynamic but slower initial loading and potential SEO challenges.
- Next.js SSR: Faster loading, improved SEO, and better performance; supports CSR when needed.
