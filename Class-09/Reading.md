### Q1. What is the purpose of dunder methods in Python? Provide an example of a commonly used dunder method.

The purpose of dunder methods in Python is to define special behaviors for classes. These methods are also known as magic methods or special methods. They allow you to override default behaviors or implement specific functionality in your own classes.

##### Example:

``` python
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

person = Person("Mahdi")
print(person.name)  

```

### Q2. In the video “AI Guru makes $238,800 with misleading paid course,” what was the main ethical issue raised concerning the use of developers’ work, and how might this have been avoided?

Siraj Raval, used code from open-source projects without giving credit to the developers. This is a violation of the open-source community's norms and can discourage developers from sharing their work.

How might this have been avoided?

This could have been avoided by giving credit to the developers of the open-source projects that he used. He could have done this by listing the projects in the course materials or by linking to the projects in the course description. He could have also asked the developers for permission to use their code. This would have been the most ethical option, as it would have given the developers the opportunity to decide whether or not they wanted their code to be used in the course.


### Q3. Describe the Python statistics module and give an example of a function within the module that can be used to perform a common statistical operation.

The Python statistics module is a built-in module that provides functions for performing statistical operations on data. It includes functions for calculating mean, median, mode, variance, standard deviation, and more. It is widely used in data analysis and scientific computing tasks.

##### Example:
``` python
import statistics

data = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 6]

mean_value = statistics.mean(data)
print(mean_value) 

```
