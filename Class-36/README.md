## DSA Review:

### Q1. What are the key pieces of advice mentioned in the “Whiteboard Advice” reading assignment for successfully tackling whiteboard interviews?

The key pieces of advice mentioned for successfully tackling whiteboard interviews:

1. **Communicate**: The most important skill to prepare for a whiteboard interview is effective communication. Don't jump straight into solving the problem. Instead, take a series of steps to communicate and clarify the problem before diving into the solution.

2. **Restate the Question**: Start by restating the problem to ensure you understand it correctly. Seek affirmation from the interviewers that your understanding is accurate. This also buys you time to think through the problem before attempting to solve it.

3. **Ask About Edge Cases**: Before writing any code, consider potential edge cases for the problem. Ask the interviewers about these edge cases and how your solution should handle them.

4. **Ask About Test Cases**: Inquire about any specific test cases that the function or solution should pass. This demonstrates your attention to testing and can highlight your testing mindset.

5. **Write Pseudocode and Check Logic**: Instead of immediately writing code, start by writing pseudocode that outlines the steps of your solution. Check the logic and approach with the interviewers to ensure your thought process is on the right track.

6. **Write the Actual Code**: Convert your pseudocode into actual code, filling in the appropriate language-specific syntax and methods.

7. **Ask for Feedback**: While writing code, periodically ask the interviewers if your solution looks good or if they have any feedback. This demonstrates your willingness to improve and your collaborative approach.

8. **Ask for Help**: If you're stuck or facing difficulties, don't hesitate to ask for help in a conversational manner. Asking for guidance is not frowned upon and can help you move forward.

9. **Communicate Prior to the Interview**: If you have the opportunity, communicate with the interview point of contact before the interview. Ask about the format, types of questions, and any specific details you should prepare for.

10. **Remember We're All Human**: Keep in mind that both you and the interviewers are human. Openly discussing problems and solutions in a conversational manner can leave a positive impression.


### Q2. From the “6 tips to ace a whiteboard programming interview” article, can you identify and explain at least two strategies that can help improve your performance during a whiteboard programming interview?


**1.Take a Few Minutes to Think:**<br>

When presented with a coding problem in an interview, many candidates rush to start solving it immediately, often trying to fill the silence with talking. However, it's important to take a moment to think through the problem before diving into the solution. The advice here is to ask clarifying questions after the interviewer explains the problem and then say something like:

"Okay, got it. If it's okay with you, I'm just going to take a minute or two here and think about the problem, and then I'll start talking."

This approach allows you to concentrate your thoughts and devise a coherent strategy for solving the problem before you begin explaining it. Taking this short pause can lead to a more organized and effective solution.

**2.Write Down the Steps of the Solution:**<br>

Instead of immediately writing down the actual code, start by writing down the high-level steps or pseudocode of how you plan to solve the problem. This can help you outline your approach clearly before you dive into writing the actual code. Writing the steps on the whiteboard, even in a rough format, can provide a roadmap for your solution and help you stay on track.

By following this strategy, you're able to demonstrate your thought process, show the structure of your solution, and ensure that you've covered all the necessary components of the solution. It also gives you a chance to discuss your approach with the interviewer before delving into the code, which can help catch any potential issues early on.

### Q3. What does Gayle McDowell say about interview preparation in the Engineering Interview Process Deconstructed video?

1. It is important to practice your coding skills. This means being able to solve coding problems quickly and efficiently. You can practice by doing coding exercises online or by working through problems in a book like "Cracking the Coding Interview".
2. Be able to explain your thought process. The interviewer wants to see how you think and how you solve problems. When you are asked a coding question, be sure to explain your thought process as you work through the problem.
3. Do not be afraid to ask questions. If you do not understand a question or if you are stuck, do not be afraid to ask the interviewer for clarification.
4. Be confident. Confidence is important, but it is also important to be humble. Do not be afraid to admit when you do not know something.
