# Engineering Readings 

## Act like you make $1000/hr:

valuing one's time as $1,000 per hour is a great way to increase productivity and focus on high-impact tasks. By prioritizing tasks that bring the most value, one can become more efficient and effective in their work. I also agree with the importance of delegating low-impact tasks to free up time for more important work. It's essential to be intentional with how we use our time and avoid distractions such as social media, which can be a huge time-waster. I believe investing in personal development and education is crucial in increasing the value of one's time in the long run. 

## How to think like a programmer:

The systematic approach recommended by the author can help programmers avoid feeling overwhelmed and lost when trying to solve complex problems. The emphasis on testing and refinement is particularly important, as it highlights the iterative nature of programming and the need to continuously improve solutions. I also appreciate the author's emphasis on seeking help when needed and being persistent in the face of challenges, as these are crucial qualities for success in programming.

# Discussion Questions:
- What’s the one thing I bring to this career (and a potential employer) that nobody else can?

Continuous update of the languages I learn: Continuous update of the languages you learn is crucial for staying relevant in the tech industry. As technology evolves, new programming languages and frameworks emerge, and older ones become obsolete. To keep up with the industry's changing demands, it is essential to continuously learn and improve your skills. This involves staying up-to-date with the latest developments in programming languages and frameworks, attending conferences and workshops, participating in online communities and forums, and reading relevant articles and books. By continuously updating your knowledge and skills, you can position yourself as a valuable asset to potential employers and increase your chances of success in the tech industry.


- What are 3 things I’ll start doing to “un-stick” myself whenever I get stuck on tough piece of code, logic, or feature?

1. Take a Break: Sometimes stepping away from the problem and doing something completely unrelated can help you come back to the problem with fresh eyes and a new perspective.

2. Break it Down: Try breaking the problem down into smaller, more manageable pieces. This can help you identify the specific area where you're struggling and allow you to focus your efforts on that specific part.

3. Collaborate: Don't be afraid to ask for help from a colleague or friend. Sometimes another person's perspective can help you see the problem in a different light and lead to a breakthrough. Additionally, pair programming can be a great way to work through challenging problems collaboratively.
