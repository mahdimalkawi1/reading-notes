## Testing and Modules:

### Q1. What are the key principles of Test-Driven Development (TDD) in Python, and how do they contribute to the overall quality of code?

TDD in Python involves writing automated tests before writing code, minimum code to pass tests, and continuous refactoring to improve quality. It ensures reliable, maintainable, and bug-free code.

### Q2. Explain the purpose of the if __name__ == '__main__': statement in Python scripts. What are some use cases for including this conditional in your code?

if __name__ == __main__: checks if a script is being run as a main program or being imported as a module. It allows defining code that runs only as a main program, for testing modules or defining command-line interfaces.

### Q3. Describe the concept of recursion in Python.

Recursion in Python is a technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem, containing a base and recursive case. It simplifies complex problems, but may cause performance issues and stack overflow errors.

### Q4. What is the difference between Python modules and packages? Explain how to create, import, and use them in your Python programs.

Modules are single files with Python code, while packages are directories with modules and an __init__.py file. To use them, import the module or package with the import statement.
